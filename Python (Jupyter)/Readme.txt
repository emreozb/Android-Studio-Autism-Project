In Jupyter notebook run script "1 - Tensorflow_Save_Model".  This will create the "autism_screener" model to the file system.

Then, run script "2 - ConvertModelToTensorflowLite" which will convert this model to a TensorflowLite file, "converter_model.tflite"

Add this tflite model as an asset to the Android Studio project to update the model to use in the mobile application.
